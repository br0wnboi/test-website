title: How my first InfoSec Conference went

I recently had the fortunate chance to visit BSides Ahemedabad 2021 and I gotta say it was crazy and fun it was much more than I ever imagined. Realling looking forward to seeing more people in confrences moving as it's so much fun meeting infosec people IRL and chatting about anything security. I almost got a job offer because of a contact I made there and I have to say contacts made in these physical confrences are invaluable over time as they can provide you with so many opportunites and chances to get your food in the InfoSec industry. That was all for now.

Peace.
