# Bought a domain, for now atleast.

Hey, I just got my GitHub Student benefits today and the first thing I did was to obtain an official domain for this lil place on the interwebs.

If you're reading this, you probably found me at `brownboi.tech`.
I was confused between br0wnboi and brownboi but I went for the latter for now as I believe it'll be easier for others to find it.

If everything goes well, I'll soon obtain the `br0wnboi` domain and redirect this to that.

For now this'll have to do.

Peace.
