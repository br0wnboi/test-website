# Welcome!

Hi to anyone who's reading this, this post marks the birth of this website, hopefully I'll be updating it regularly, I'm gonna post anything I learn about here maybe even some tutorials.

This website has been hosted on github as of now, future plans include buying
a proper domain name for it like,

* brownboi.tech
* br0wnboi.tech
* br0wnboi.me
* br0wnboi.xyz

I'm still thinking about which one to go for, future plan is to eventually get both of those and redirect them to each other and use the `br0wnboi.*` as the main domain.

I guess that's it for now.
Peace. \*<3\*
