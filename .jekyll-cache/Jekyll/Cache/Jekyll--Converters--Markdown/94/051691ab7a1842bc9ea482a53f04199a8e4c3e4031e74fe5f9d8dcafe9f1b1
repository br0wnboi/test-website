<p>Hey, I just got my GitHub Student benefits today and the first thing I did was to obtain an official domain for this lil place on the interwebs.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re reading this, you probably found me at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brownboi.tech</code>.
I was confused between br0wnboi and brownboi but I went for the latter for now as I believe itâ€™ll be easier for others to find it.</p>

<p>If everything goes well, Iâ€™ll soon obtain the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">br0wnboi</code> domain and redirect this to that.</p>

<p>For now thisâ€™ll have to do.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>
