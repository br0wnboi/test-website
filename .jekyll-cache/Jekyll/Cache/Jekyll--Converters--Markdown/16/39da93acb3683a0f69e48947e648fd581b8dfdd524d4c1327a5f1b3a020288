<p>Hi to anyone whoâ€™s reading this, this post marks the birth of this website, hopefully Iâ€™ll be updating it regularly, Iâ€™m gonna post anything I learn about here maybe even some tutorials.</p>

<p>This website has been hosted on github as of now, future plans include buying
a proper domain name for it like,</p>

<ul>
  <li>brownboi.tech</li>
  <li>br0wnboi.tech</li>
  <li>br0wnboi.me</li>
  <li>br0wnboi.xyz</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m still thinking about which one to go for, future plan is to eventually get both of those and redirect them to each other and use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">br0wnboi.*</code> as the main domain.</p>

<p>I guess thatâ€™s it for now.
Peace. *&lt;3*</p>
